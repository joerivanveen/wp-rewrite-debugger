Debug rewrite issues by logging before and after situations

== Description ==

Specific for /project/ rewrite issues at the moment.

Will log the rewrite rules each day in a new logfile.

Additionally: will log when a 404 is encountered in the /project/ directory, and flush rewrite rules when the /project/ rules are no longer present.
